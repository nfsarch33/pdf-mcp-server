# Memory routing SOP (auto)
# - If the user says "add to rules": only put short, universal, stable rules here.
# - If the user says "add to memory": put procedures/checklists in Pepper (~/memo/global-memories).
# - If it is historical/RCA/old versions: put it in global-kb (~/Code/global-kb) or OS KB (kb CLI).
#
# Secrets policy (local dev):
# - For local development on this machine, it is acceptable to keep MCP credentials as static values in ~/.cursor/mcp.json.
# - Never commit secrets to open source repos or store them inside repo rules files.
#
# Pepper (git) key files:
# - memory-sop.md, coding-standards-v9-1.md, mcp-index-and-selection-sop.md
# - release-sop-tag-based.md, release-sop-checklist.md, pdf-handler-troubleshooting.md
# - pdf-mcp-server-status.md (project tracker)
#
# Version strategy:
# - Single source of truth: pyproject.toml -> version field
# - Runtime: from pdf_mcp import __version__
# - CI gate: scripts/check_release_ready.py validates tag == pyproject.toml
# - Release: tag push v*.*.* triggers .github/workflows/release.yml (auto)
#
# Repo doc layout (permanent)
# - Canonical, portable onboarding/runbooks live under `PROJECT_MEMO/`.
# - Root-level `GLOBAL_CURSOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and `MEMORY_AND_RULES.md` remain as short redirect stubs only
#   (to avoid breaking links/bookmarks); do NOT reintroduce full copies at repo root.
# - Portable KB items intended for Pepper sync live under `PROJECT_MEMO/PEPPER_SYNC/memories-and-kb/`.
#
# Quality gates before calling work "done": tests pass; errors handled; docs updated.
