# Memory System

Layers: `.cursor/rules/` (always) | `~/memo/` (Pepper, on-demand) | `~/Code/global-kb/` (archive).

Route: every-chat rule -> rules/ | procedure -> Pepper | investigation -> global-kb.

Commands: "health check" | "daily memo sync"

Prefer MCP tools over shell. No emojis in code/docs. Conventional commits.
