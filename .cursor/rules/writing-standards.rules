# Writing Standards (Required)

## Concise Output (All Artifacts)

All commits, PR descriptions, code comments, docs, and messages must be:
- Short and factual. No filler, no verbose explanations.
- One-line commits: `type: what changed`. Add body only if non-obvious.
- PR bodies: bullet summary + test plan. No essays.
- Code comments: only for non-obvious logic or public API docs.
- Docs: direct, scannable, no redundant prose.

## No AI Attribution (Zero Tolerance)

Never add to any artifact:
- "made by cursor", "co-authored by cursor", "generated by AI"
- Any co-author trailers, AI tool credits, or assistant mentions
- This applies to commits, PRs, comments, docs, changelogs -- everything

## Skills-First Priority

On every task, before starting work:
1. Check if an installed Agent Skill matches the task domain.
2. If yes, read and follow the skill SKILL.md.
3. If unsure, run `npx skills find [keyword]` to search the ecosystem.
4. Skills index: project `.cursor/skills/` + global `~/.cursor/skills/` + `~/.agents/skills/`.

## MCP Machine Context

This workspace may run on multiple machines. At task start:
- Identify machine: `hostname` + `uname -sm` if MCP tool selection matters.
- MCP server availability varies per machine. Check Pepper `mcp-index-and-selection-sop.md` for the canonical index.
- Do not assume all MCP servers from another machine are available locally.
