# Project Memo (portable)

This folder exists to make it easy to **pick up this repo on a new computer** with minimal context loss.

## What lives here

- Portable, repo-scoped notes only (no machine paths required, no secrets).
- “How to run / test / release / troubleshoot” for `pdf-handler`.
- Pointers to the **canonical** multi-layer memory system (Pepper/global-kb) when available.

## What must NOT live here

- Secrets/tokens/passwords (Cursor `mcp.json` credentials, API keys, etc.).
- Personal/academic notes (keep those untracked and/or in private repos).

## Quick start

Read in order:

1. `MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md`
2. `RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md`
3. `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
